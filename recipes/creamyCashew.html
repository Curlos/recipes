  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Cashew cream is delicately sweet with a hint of nuttiness that lends an earthy depth. Next, the texture: Used as a sauce, it has an incredibly silky finish that is creamy without feeling heavy. The whipped consistency clings lovingly around every strand of noodle, and it pairs well with the pan-fried mushrooms, which are golden and crisp and provide pops of umami flavor. The black vinegar and soy sauce topping delivers much-appreciated acidity, heat, and assertive saltiness—you can also use it as a dip for dumplings.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>CASHEW CREAM </strong>
        <ul>
          
          <li>1 cup raw cashews</li>
          <li>1 garlic clove, coarsely chopped</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>NOODLES AND ASSEMBLY</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>2 Tbsp. black (Chinkiang) vinegar</li>
          <li>2 Tbsp. chili crisp or chili oil</li>
          <li>2 Tbsp. soy sauce</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil</li>
          <li>3 scallions, thinly sliced, divided</li>
          <li>2–3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>1 lb. oyster, shiitake, crimini, or button mushrooms, torn or cut into bite-size pieces</li>
          <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
          <li>½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more</li>
          <li>28 oz. fresh or frozen udon noodles</li>
          <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <h3>CASHEW CREAM</h3>
  <li>Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, then remove from heat. Add cashews and let sit until tender, 30–60 minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain cashews and transfer to a blender (preferably high-speed) or food processor. Add garlic, oil, salt, and ½ cup water and purée until smooth.</li>

  <h3>NOODLES AND ASSEMBLY</h3>
  <li>Stir vinegar, chili crisp, soy sauce, sesame oil, and 1 scallion in a small bowl to combine; set soy-vinegar sauce aside.</li>
  <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook mushrooms, tossing every minute or so but leaving mostly undisturbed, until mostly golden and crisp, 5–8 minutes, depending on type of mushroom you use (oyster and shiitakes will cook quicker, while crimini and button mushrooms will take a bit longer). Add garlic and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt and cook, stirring often and adding another 1 Tbsp. olive oil if the mushrooms are looking dry, 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.
  </li>
  <li>Add noodles and cashew cream to pan with mushrooms and cook, stirring and adding reserved cooking liquid a little at a time, until cream is loose and coats noodles. Season with salt and pepper.
  </li>
  <li>To serve, divide noodles among bowls and generously drizzle each with reserved soy-vinegar sauce. Top with remaining scallions.</li>
</ol>
