  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Carrots are often relegated to supporting roles in soups, braises, and stews that take advantage of their sweetness but hardly make them the star. This salad lets them shine, roasted alongside chickpeas and taken to the next level by an herbaceous cashew cream. Blitzing the base cashew cream recipe with dill, parsley, and scallions brings fresh balance to the carrots. Serve extra sauce as a dip with crudités or grilled bread.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <h3>CASHEW CREAM</h3>
  <li>Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, then remove from heat. Add cashews and let sit until tender, 30–60 minutes.</li>
  <li>Drain cashews and transfer to a blender (preferably high-speed) or food processor. Add garlic, oil, salt, and ½ cup water and purée until smooth.</li>

  <h3>CARROTS AND ASSEMBLY</h3>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350°. Toast almonds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until slightly darkened and fragrant, 8–10 minutes. Let cool; finely chop. Reserve baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Increase oven temperature to 425°. Purée cashew cream, scallions, dill, parsley, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, ⅛ tsp. pepper, and ¼ cup water in a blender until smooth. Set herby cashew cream aside.</li>
  <li>Place carrots and chickpeas on reserved baking sheet. Drizzle 4 Tbsp. oil over and sprinkle cumin, paprika, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and remaining ⅛ tsp. pepper on top; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer and roast 10 minutes. Remove carrots and chickpeas from oven and toss. Return to oven and roast until carrots are tender and mostly golden and chickpeas are crisp, 10–15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Place salad greens in a large bowl; drizzle in remaining 1 Tbsp. lemon juice and 1 Tbsp. oil and season with remaining ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Toss to coat.
  </li>
  <li>Arrange greens on a platter, then spoon carrots and chickpeas on top. Drizzle with reserved herby cashew cream and top with almonds.</li>
